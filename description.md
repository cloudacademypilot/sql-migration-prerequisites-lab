**Azure Migrate** provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Azure. All pre-migration steps such as discovery, assessments, and right-sizing of on-premises resources are included for infrastructure, data, and applications. Azure Migrateâ€™s extensible framework allows for integration of third-party tools, thus expanding the scope of supported use-cases.

The **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.

In this Lab, you will learn how to:

- Configure dependency analysis in **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**.
- Use the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) automation script (SMF_DMAPreReqAssessCombo_V5.8.ps1) to detect/assess the issues in on-premise SQL Servers.
- Use the Network Validation script (Network_Validation.ps1) to perform the basic checks on target SQL environmnent.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand the pre-requisites required for performing the SQL migration.

## Intended Audience
