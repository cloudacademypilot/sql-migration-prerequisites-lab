# DMA Assessment

## Data Migration Assistant

**The Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server. 

## Capabilities of DMA

- Assess on-premises SQL Server instance(s) migrating to Azure SQL database(s). The assessment workflow helps you to detect the following issues that can affect Azure SQL database migration and provides detailed guidance on how to resolve them.

    - Migration blocking issues: Discovers the compatibility issues that block migrating on-premises SQL Server database(s) to Azure SQL Database(s). DMA provides recommendations to help you address those issues.

    - Partially supported or unsupported features: Detects partially supported or unsupported features that are currently in use on the source SQL Server instance. DMA provides a comprehensive set of recommendations, alternative approaches available in Azure, and mitigating steps so that you can incorporate them into your migration projects.

- Discover issues that can affect an upgrade to an on-premises SQL Server. These are described as compatibility issues and are organized in the following categories:
    - Breaking changes
    - Behavior changes
    - Deprecated features

- Discover new features in the target SQL Server platform that the database can benefit from after an upgrade. These are described as feature recommendations and are organized in the following categories:
    - Performance
    - Security
    - Storage

- Migrate an on-premises SQL Server instance to a modern SQL Server instance hosted on-premises or on an Azure virtual machine (VM) that is accessible from your on-premises network. The Azure VM can be accessed using VPN or other technologies. The migration workflow helps you to migrate the following components:
    - Schema of databases
    - Data and users
    - Server roles
    - SQL Server and Windows logins

- After a successful migration, applications can connect to the target SQL Server databases seamlessly.

- Assess on-premises SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package(s) migrating to Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance. The assessment helps to discover issues that can affect the migration. These are described as compatibility issues and are organized in the following categories:
    - Migration blockers: discovers the compatibility issues that block migrating source package(s) to Azure. DMA provides recommendations to help you address those issues.
    - Information issues: detects partially supported or deprecated features that are used in source package(s).

## DMA Assessments to migrate to Azure SQL Database(s)

## Learning Objectives

This lab step is to provide the detailed procedure/step to use the **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** automation script (```SMF_DMAPreReqAssessCombo_V5.8.ps1```) to detect/assess the following issues in on-premise SQL Servers:

- Migration blocking issues: 
    - To discover the compatibility issues that block migrating on-premises SQL Server database(s) to Azure SQL Database
    - To discover the compatibility issues that block migrating on-premises SQL Server database(s) to Azure SQL Managed Instance
    - To discover the compatibility issues that block migrating on-premises SQL Server database(s) to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines 
- Compatibility issues - Data Migration Assistant also identifies compatibility issues related to the following areas:
    - Breaking changes: The specific schema objects that may break the functionality migrating to the target database. We recommend fixing these schema objects after the database migration.
    - Behavioral changes: The schema objects reported may continue to work, but they may exhibit a different behavior, for example performance degradation.
    - Informational issues: These objects won't impact the migration but may have been deprecated from feature SQL Server releases.
- And to initiate & terminate the data-collection process for the target SKU assessment.

## Prerequisites for DMA Assessment

- Virtual Machine - Already setup for you.
- Software & PowerShell module:
    - .NET Core 3.1.28
    - .NET Framework 4.8

3. Give ```2``` as input value and hit enter to perform DMA Assessment. After triggering the automation all the support folders( Archive , output , Downloads etc. ) will be created automatically by the automation script in the ```C:\Users\sqladmin``` folder. 

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/37.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/38.jpg)
    
    > Note: .Net 4.8, .Net Core, DMA and ImportExcel PS module are required for this assessment.  

4. **.Net 4.8** is already available in the virtual machine. So, it will ask for your input to install **DMA**. Enter ```Y``` to download & install the DMA 5.6.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/39.jpg)

5. Once DMA is installed, it will check for **.Net Core** availability and ask for your input to install **.Net Core**. Enter ```Y``` to install .Net Core.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/40.jpg)

6. Next it will check for ImportExcel PowerShell module and then install it.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/41.jpg)

    At the end of script Pop up will appear where you need to enter the username and Password. This step is required only for the validation of         completion of script.


7. After all the requirements are installed, DMA assessment will run and it will bring up a pop up window where the DMA assessment result is available as shown below.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/43.jpg)

8. Go to ```C:\Users\sqladmin\output``` path and copy all the files and paste it in any other folder. You need them in next exercise.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/43-1.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/43-2.jpg)

9. Go back to **Windows PowerShell** and Press any key to continue. It will close the PowerShell window.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/42.jpg)

10. Again you need to run the script to Perform performance data gathering. In ```C:\Users\sqladmin``` path, right-click on ```SMF_DMAPreReqAssessCombo_V5.8.ps1``` script and select **Run with PowerShell** to run the script.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/35.jpg)

11. Give ```3``` as input value to select Perform performance data gathering. This will gather all the data required to provide you with SKU recommendation.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/44.jpg)

12. It will again check for all the prerequisites and ask for your input. Enter ```Y``` to continue performance data collection. 

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/45.jpg)

13. Upon entering ```Y``` the console will ask for two additional parameters:
   
   - Please Provide the Data Collection duration in Day/s – Here , please put any value between 0 to 15 .
> Note : There might be a situation where user may want to run this for less than 24 hours , in that situation user should put 0.

In the below example we put the day range as 0.

   ![DMA Assessment](assets/46.png)
    
   - Next the console will ask Hour value (Please Provide the Data Collection duration Hours) – Here , please put any value between 0 to 23. And press enter.
> Note : If you put the Day value as 0 , please do not put the Hour value as 0 ( It should be anything between 1-23 )

In the below example we put the hour range as 1.

   ![DMA Assessment](assets/47.jpg)

14. After that the process will initiate. The process will continue to run as per the time range provided by the user in the last step and terminate automatically (Note – User also can terminate the process by pressing enter key).

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/48.jpg)

This will allow the performance data to be collected to select the best Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, or SQL Server on Azure VM target and SKU for your database. Database Migration Assistant (DMA) helps address these questions and make your database migration experience easier by providing these SKU recommendations. It is recommended that the performance data gathering is run for minimum four hours during the peak SQL Server workloads.

After running for a specific period of time, the process will stop executing on its own as per the Day/Hour values provided by the user, otherwise Press Enter Key in the window where the script is running.

15. Wait for 1-2 minutes and press enter to terminate the process. It will bring up a pop up window where the SKU performance results are available.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/49.jpg)
    
16. Go back to **Windows PowerShell** and Press any key to continue. It will close the PowerShell window.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/43-3.jpg)

17.  Search for ```powershell``` in the **Search bar** at the bottom and Click on **Run as Administrator**.

     ![DMA Assessment](assets/49-1.jpg)

18. Navigate to **C:\Program Files\Microsoft Data Migration Assistant\SqlAssessmentConsole** path by entering ```cd 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Data Migration Assistant\SqlAssessmentConsole'``` 

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/49-2.jpg)

19. Execute the following command to generate Azure SQL SKU Recommendation Report.
    
    ```
    .\SqlAssessment.exe GetSkuRecommendation --outputFolder C:\Users\sqladmin\output\PerfData --targetPlatform AzureSqlVirtualMachine
    ```

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/49-3.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/49-4.jpg)

> Note: You can also generate SKU recommendation for Managed Instance and SQL database by changing the target platform to **AzureSqlManagedInstance** and **AzureSqlDatabase** respectively in the above command replacing **AzureSqlVirtualMachine**.

20. Go to ```C:\Users\sqladmin\output\PerfData``` path, you will see two report files and three csv files.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/49-5.jpg)

21. Open the ```SkuRecommendationReport{*}.html``` file and click on the source virtual machine name. You will see SKU recommendations like compute size, platform, storage size etc. Recommended compute size is given as **D2as_v4**, which we have used in this lab to create the target virtual machine. Click on **View** under **Justifications** and **Requirements** to see more details about the SKU recommendations.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/56.jpg) 
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/57.jpg) 
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/58.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/59.jpg) 

5. Now you are inside the source **virtual machine**. **Server Manager** window will pop up. Please close it.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/60.jpg)    

6. Search for ```SSMS``` in the **Search bar** at the bottom and Open it.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/61.jpg)

7. **Connect to Server** window will pop up. Click **Connect** to connect to the server. 

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/62.jpg)

8. Expand **Databases** by clicking on ⊕. You will see two databases by default: ```SampleDatabase1``` and ```SampleDatabase2```. Please refresh if you are not able to see the databases.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/63.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/64.jpg)

## Exercise 6: Executing SQL queries on source database to increase complexity and create compatibility issues

1. Click on **New Query** and Copy-Paste the following query and click **Execute**. 
    
    ```
    use SampleDatabase1
    Go
    create proc Display_Files_CDrive
    as
    begin
    DECLARE @CommandL1 varchar(512)
    SET @CommandL1 = 'dir C:\'
    exec master..xp_cmdshell @CommandL1
    end
    GO
    ```

    xp_cmdshell which spawns a Windows command shell and passes in a string for execution is not supported in Azure SQL Database.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/65.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/66.jpg)

2. Click on **New Query** and Copy-Paste the following query and click **Execute**.    
    
    ```
    use SampleDatabase1
    Go
    Create proc uspPrintShift
    as
    begin
    select distinct sdb1.Name  from SampleDatabase1.[SalesLT].[Product] sdb1
    left join SampleDatabase2.[SalesLT].[Product] sdb2
    on sdb2.ProductID =sdb1.ProductID
    end
    Go
    ```

    Azure SQL Database does not support cross-database queries. Here we are creating compatibility issue by running a cross-database query.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/67.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/68.jpg)

3. Click on **New Query** and Copy-Paste the following query and click **Execute**.    
        
    ```
    use SampleDatabase1
    Go
    Create table SalesLT.Job_Description
    (
    Jobid int,
    jobDescription Text
    )
    Go
    ```
    
    Datatypes like TEXT, IMAGE or NTEXT are deprecated.
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/69.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/70.jpg)

4. Click on **New Query** and Copy-Paste the following query and click **Execute**.    
        
    ```
    ALTER DATABASE SampleDatabase1 SET ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE
    GO
    ```

    SQL Server Service Broker provides native support for messaging and queuing applications in the SQL Server Database Engine. Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database. Here we are creating a compatibility issue by enabling broker feature.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/71.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/72.jpg)

5. Now again go back to DMA virtual machine and perform the instructions from **1 to 8** of **Exercise 4** again. And Copy the files to one more new folder like you did in Exercise 4. 

## Exercise 7: Comparing compatibility 

Here we will compare the output of **Exercise 4**(without any compatibility issues) and **Exercise 6**(after creating compatibility issues).

1. Open the folder where you copied the outputs in **Exercise 4**. And open the DMA file.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/74.jpg)
    
2. Here you can see there are no compatibiliy issues with both databases.
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/75.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/76.jpg)

3. Now open the folder where you copied the outputs in **Exercise 6** after executing SQL queries. And open the DMA file.

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/77.jpg)

4. Here you can see there are 3 compatibiliy issues with **SampleDatabase1** database beacuse we executed the queries only on SampleDatabase1 database. And there are no compatibiliy issues with **SampleDatabase2** database as we have not done anything on this database. 

    ![DMA Assessment](assets/78.jpg)
    
    ![DMA Assessment](assets/79.jpg)

5. You can click on each compatibility issues to see more details like impacts while migrating and recommendations for migration.
    - **xp_cmdshell** is not supported in Azure SQL Database.

      ![DMA Assessment](assets/83.jpg)
    
    - **cross-database** queries are not supported in Azure SQL Database.

      ![DMA Assessment](assets/82.jpg)
    
    - Using **TEXT**, **IMAGE** or **NTEXT** might harm performance and are discontinued.

      ![DMA Assessment](assets/80.jpg)
    
    - **Service Broker** feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database.

      ![DMA Assessment](assets/81.jpg)
