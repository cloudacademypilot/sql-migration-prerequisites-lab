## Exercise 3: Preparing the Input excel file

1. Since this virtual machine is based on SQL server image, it won't have ```MS Office``` installed, so you can't edit the file here. To edit the excel file copy-paste this ```Network_Validation.xlsx``` file to another virtual machine name starting with ```DMA{*}``` where you edited the excel in the previous lab step.
