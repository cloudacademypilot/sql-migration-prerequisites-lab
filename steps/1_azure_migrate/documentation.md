Azure Migrate Application Dependency Mapping/Assessment

This exercise provides step by step procedures to configure dependency analysis in Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment.
Dependency analysis identifies dependencies between discovered on-premises servers. It provides these advantages:

• This lets us to gather servers into groups for assessment more accurately. 

• Identification of servers that must be migrated together. This is especially useful if there are no data about app dependency.

• Analyzing dependencies helps ensure that nothing is left behind, and thus avoids surprise outages after migration.
