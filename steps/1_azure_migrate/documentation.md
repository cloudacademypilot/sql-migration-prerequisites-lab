# Azure Migrate Application Dependency Mapping/Assessment

This lab provides step by step procedures to configure dependency analysis in **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**.

Dependency analysis identifies dependencies between discovered on-premises servers. It provides these advantages:

- This lets us to gather servers into groups for assessment more accurately.
- Identification of servers that must be migrated together. This is especially useful if there are no data about app dependency.
- Analyzing dependencies helps ensure that nothing is left behind, and thus avoids surprise outages after migration.

## Create a project for the first time

Set up a new project in an Azure subscription -

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Azure Migrate**.

2. In Services , select **Azure Migrate**.

3. In Overview , select **Discover, assess, and migrate**.

    ![AzureMigrate](assets/image1.png)

4. In Servers, databases, and web apps , select **Create project**.

    ![AzureMigrate](assets/image2.png)

5. In Create project , select the **Azure subscription**, and **resource group**.

6. In Project Details , specify the **project name** as **adventureMigrate** and the **geography** in which you want to create the project.

    - The geography is only used to store the metadata gathered from on-premises servers. You can assess or migrate servers for any target region regardless of the selected geography.

7. Select **Create** to initiate Project deployment.

## DEPENDANCY ANALYSIS:

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the Azure Migrate blade in the Azure Portal, and select Servers databases and web apps. Under Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment select Groups, then select the AdventureVMs group to see the group details. Note that each VM has their Dependencies status as Requires agent installation. Select Requires agent installation for the web1 VM.

2. On the Dependencies blade, select Configure OMS workspace.

3. Create a new OMS workspace. Use AzureMigrateWS<unique number> as the workspace name, where <unique number> is a random number. Choose a workspace location close to your lab deployment, then select Configure.
    
4.Wait for the Log Analytics workspace to be deployed. Once it is deployed, navigate to it, and select Agents management under Settings on the left. Make a note of the Workspace ID and Primary Key (for example by using Notepad). 
    
5. Return to the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade. Copy each of the 2 agent download URLs and paste them alongside the Workspace ID and key you noted in the previous step.
    
6. Connect to the Web server1 and Open Edge, and paste the link to the 64-bit Microsoft Monitoring Agent for Windows, which you noted earlier. When prompted, Run the installer.
    
7. Select through the installation wizard until you get to the Agent Setup Options page. From there, select Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS) and select Next. Enter the Workspace ID and Workspace Key that you copied earlier, and select Azure Commercial from the Azure Cloud drop-down. Select through the remaining pages and install the agent.

8. Now paste the link to the Dependency Agent Windows installer into the browser address bar. Run the installer and select through the install wizard to complete the installation.
    
9. Connect to the SQL and web2 VM and repeat the installation process (steps 6-8) for both agents.
