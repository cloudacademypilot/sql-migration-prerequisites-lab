# Azure Migrate Application Dependency Mapping/Assessment

This lab provides step by step procedures to configure dependency analysis in **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**.

Dependency analysis identifies dependencies between discovered on-premises servers. It provides these advantages:

- This lets us to gather servers into groups for assessment more accurately.
- Identification of servers that must be migrated together. This is especially useful if there are no data about app dependency.
- Analyzing dependencies helps ensure that nothing is left behind, and thus avoids surprise outages after migration.

## Create a project for the first time

Set up a new project in an Azure subscription -

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Azure Migrate**.

2. In Services , select **Azure Migrate**.

3. In Overview , select **Discover, assess, and migrate**.

    ![AzureMigrate](assets/image1.png)

4. In Servers, databases, and web apps , select **Create project**.

    ![AzureMigrate](assets/image2.png)

5. In Create project , select the **Azure subscription**, and **resource group**.

6. In Project Details , specify the **project name** and the **geography** in which you want to create the project.

    - The geography is only used to store the metadata gathered from on-premises servers. You can assess or migrate servers for any target region regardless of the selected geography.

7. Select **Create** to initiate Project deployment.
