# Azure Migrate Application Dependency Mapping/Assessment

This lab provides step by step procedures to configure dependency analysis in **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**.

Dependency analysis identifies dependencies between discovered on-premises servers. It provides these advantages:

- This lets us to gather servers into groups for assessment more accurately.
- Identification of servers that must be migrated together. This is especially useful if there are no data about app dependency.
- Analyzing dependencies helps ensure that nothing is left behind, and thus avoids surprise outages after migration.

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to assess the servers and application. You will learn how to use Azure Migrate as the hub for discovery and assessement, together with accompanying tools.

## Overview

Before the lab, you will have pre-deployed an on-premises infrastructure hosted as Azure VMs.  This infrastructure is hosting a multi-tier application called 'adventure', using Azure VMs for each of the application tiers.

During the lab, you will migrate this entire application to Azure. This will include assessing the on-premises application using Azure Migrate and  assessing the database migration using Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)

## Solution architecture

The Adventure application comprises 3 VMs hosted in Azure:

- **Database tier** Hosted on the SourceSQLServer VM, which is running SQL Server 2019.

- **Application tier** Hosted on the WebServer1 and WebServer2 VM, which is running Windows Server 2019.

In the Deployed resource group the VM that starts with 

- SourceXXXX will be reffered as SourceSQLServer in the lab
- WebServer1XXXX will be reffered as WebServer1 in the lab
- WebServer2XXXX will be reffered as WebServer2 in the lab

## Hosting Web Application

## Connecting to application server virtual machine via RDP

1. Go to **Azure portal** and click on hamburger button ☰ on top-left side and select **Resource groups**. Select the resource group deployed in the Azure Portal. Amongst the list of resources, open the **virtual machine** .

2. Click on **Connect** and then click **Select** to connect via native RDP. Click **Download RDP file** to download.

3. File will be downloaded inside **Downloads** folder in your local system. Open the RDP file. Then select **Connect**.

DEPENDANCY ANALYSIS:


When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the Azure Migrate blade in the Azure Portal, and select Servers databases and web apps. Under Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment select Groups, then select the AdventureVMs group to see the group details. Note that each VM has their Dependencies status as Requires agent installation. Select Requires agent installation for the web1 VM.
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency1.jpg)
    
2. On the Dependencies blade, select Configure OMS workspace.
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency2.png)
    
3. Create a new OMS workspace. Use AzureMigrateWS as the workspace name, where is a random number. Choose a workspace location close to your lab deployment, then select Configure.
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency3.png)
    
4. Wait for the Log Analytics workspace to be deployed. Once it is deployed, navigate to it, and select Agents under Settings on the left. Make a note of the Workspace ID and Primary Key (for example by using Notepad).
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency4.jpg)
    
5. Return to the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade. Copy each of the 2 agent download URLs and paste them alongside the Workspace ID and key you noted in the previous step.
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency5.jpg)
    
6. Connect to the Web server1 and Open Edge, and paste the link to the 64-bit Microsoft Monitoring Agent for Windows, which you noted earlier. When prompted, Run the installer. First you need to unistall.
Note : Machine Restart is NOT required.
   
   ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency6_1.jpg)
    
Re launch the installer 
   
   ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency6_2.jpg)
    
7. Select through the installation wizard until you get to the Agent Setup Options page. From there, select Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS) and select Next. Enter the Workspace ID and Workspace Key that you copied earlier, and select Azure Commercial from the Azure Cloud drop-down. Select through the remaining pages and install the agent.
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency7_1.jpg)
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency7_2.jpg)
    
8. Now paste the link to the Dependency Agent Windows installer into the browser address bar. Run the installer and select through the install wizard to complete the installation.
    
    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency8.jpg)
    
Connect to the SQL and web2 VM and repeat the installation process (steps 6-8) for both agents.

The agent installation is now complete. Next, you need to generate some traffic on the hosted application so the dependency visualization has some data to work with. Browse to the public IP address of the Web1 server, and spend a few minutes refreshing the page.

####Explore dependency visualization

In this task, you will explore the dependency visualization feature of Azure Migrate. This feature uses data gathered by the dependency agent you installed in above task.

1. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate adventureGroup VMs group blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as 'Installed'. (If not, refresh the page using the browser refresh button, not the refresh button in the blade. It may take up to 5 minutes after installation for the status to be updated.)

    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency9.jpg)

2. Select View dependencies.

    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency10.jpg)

3. Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Select a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.

    ![AzureMigrate](assets/dependency11.jpg)

In this exercise, you used Azure Migrate to assess the on-premises environment. This included selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

Next you can proceed with Actual lift and sift of server using the Azure Migrate. For details please go thorugh below link :
