# Azure Migrate Application Dependency Mapping/Assessment

This lab provides step by step procedures to configure dependency analysis in **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**.

Dependency analysis identifies dependencies between discovered on-premises servers. It provides these advantages:

- This lets us to gather servers into groups for assessment more accurately.
- Identification of servers that must be migrated together. This is especially useful if there are no data about app dependency.
- Analyzing dependencies helps ensure that nothing is left behind, and thus avoids surprise outages after migration.

## Create a project for the first time

Set up a new project in an Azure subscription -

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Azure Migrate**.

2. In Services , select **Azure Migrate**.

3. In Overview , select **Discover, assess, and migrate**.

4. In Servers, databases, and web apps , select **Create project**.

5. In Create project , select the **Azure subscription**, and **resource group**.

6. In Project Details , specify the **project name** and the **geography** in which you want to create the project.

    - The geography is only used to store the metadata gathered from on-premises servers. You can assess or migrate servers for any target region regardless of the selected geography.

7. Select **Create** to initiate Project deployment.

9. Now Set up Prerequisites.


10. Provide the Appliance Key that was generated on the Azure Portal and click verify.


11. Click login to authenticate with Azure Credentials.





12. Once Azure credentials are authenticated. Proceed adding Domain credentials.


13. Now add discovery source. Specify the IP address and the friendly name with given format.
14. Verify the input post adding the values.


15. If any validation fails, fix the error, and do revalidate.


16. Specify the SQL credentials for SQL DB discovery.


17. Now click Start discovery to initiate the discovery process.


## DEPENDANCY ANALYSIS:

18. Go back to Discovered server in Azure Migrate Hub, to enable the dependency mapping.


19. Click on Dependency analysis and select Add servers.
20. Select the servers that needs dependency mapping to initiate the analysis.


21. Oncer servers are added to analysis, you can now see option to view dependencies.


22. Click and each server to view respective dependency analysis.
