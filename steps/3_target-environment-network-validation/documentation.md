# Network Validation

## Learning Objectives

This lab step is to provide the detailed procedure/step to use the Network Validation script (Network_Validation.ps1) to perform the following basic checks on target SQL environmnent:
- Check for target server IP address
- Check for network diagnostics
- Check for firewall settings
- Check for infrastructure validation
- Check connection w.r.t port and server

## Prerequisites

- Virtual Machine - Already setup for you.
- ImportExcel and Az module  
- Input Excel File - The Network Validation script is based on the worksheet named ```Network_Validation.xlsx```

## Exercise 1: Connecting to virtual machine via RDP

1. Go to **Azure portal** and click on hamburger button â˜° on top-left side and select **Resource groups**. Select the resource group deployed in the Azure Portal. Amongst the list of resources, open the **virtual machine** starting with name ```DMA```.

## Exercise 3: Preparing the Input excel file

1. We need **Excel** to edit the input excel file. Since **CloudAcademy** lab credentials don't have license to MS office. Please use your Microsoft account to use MS office for editing.

2. Search for ```Office``` in the **Search bar** at the bottom and click **Open**.
