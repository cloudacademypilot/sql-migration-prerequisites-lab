# Network Validation

## Learning Objectives

This lab step is to provide the detailed procedure/step to use the Network Validation script (Network_Validation.ps1) to perform the following basic checks on target SQL environmnent:
- Check for target server IP address
- Check for network diagnostics
- Check for firewall settings
- Check for infrastructure validation
- Check connection w.r.t port and server
- Check diskspace

## Prerequisites

- Virtual Machine - Already setup for you.
- ImportExcel and Az module  
- Input Excel File - The Network Validation script is based on the worksheet named ```Network_Validation.xlsx```
